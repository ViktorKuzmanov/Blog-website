# Blog web app

Simple blog web app I created as a challenge from the course I'm learning web development from.

## Installation

Install all dependencies I use in the project

```bash
npm install
```
Start the server on port 3000

```bash
node app.js
```
## Usage

Create new blog post at http://localhost:3000/compose

Check out your post at http://localhost:3000/posts/<postName>

# What I've learned developing this app

- How to create footer and header using EJS layouts;
- How to use EJS template to create the Homepage of all blog posts;
- Saving data to MongoDB using Mongoose;
- Create page for every blog post dynamically using Express Route parameters;
- Fetch blog posts data from MongoDB using Mongoose;
- How to plagiarize code (Just kidding :D);

This web application is in phase-out (The software may still be used but no further changes are
made to it).
